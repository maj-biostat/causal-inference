    "text": "What did they do?\nThe authors introduce the findings of observational obesity studies and then define the causal question that is being asked. They highlight consistency violations as the chief issue and explain how this leads to a cascade of problems that compromise the inference.\n\nA mind experiment\nThe paper starts with a mind experiment. Three randomised trials are run to estimate the effect of obesity on mortality. The end use is to inform a policy for reducing excess death attributable to obesity. The first study randomises a mandated exercise program as the intervention group, the second randomises a diet, the third randomises both. In all three studies, the control group is behaviour as usual.\nPredictably, there is variation in the results. In all, the distribution of BMI and rate mortality are lower in the intervention group. However, the mortality varies across the studies. The implication is that the effect of obesity is unknown, but to inform a policy decision, simply pick the study/intervention with the greatest reduction in mortality.\nAn observational study is then run using population-level data on BMI, death and risk factors on lifestyle and death. In this study, the effect of obesity on mortality is reported.\nThe authors raise the question of how it is possible that the observational study appears more suitable than the RCT in answering causal questions on the health effects of obesity.\n\n\nWhy the paradox?\nSimply, RCTs compare the distribution of the outcome under differing experimental conditions. In the mind experiment these conditions were physical activity, diet or both relative to behaviour as usual. The effects are attributable to the intervention, not obesity. In contrast, an observational study allows you to compare the mortality rate based on the definition of obesity, e.g. \\(BMI \\gt 30\\) adjusted for relevant factors. Implicit in the observational result is the notion of some, likely multi-factorial and individual-specific, intervention that reduces weight to normal levels. And, as the Prince of Denmark said, there’s the rub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they are to provide a single estimate for the effect of obesity, the observational data analyst has to\n\nassume that all interventions on BMI have the same effect on mortality or\nconsider a complex intervention that changes the determinants of BMI in proportion to the distribution of those determinants in those who are not obese in the population\n\nBoth of these have problems; (1) is unlikely to be true (2) is unlikely to be feasible.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormalisation\nWe know that causal inference requires consistency, exchangeability and positivity.\nAs alluded to, the authors argue that consistency (the causal contrast involves two or more well-defined interventions1) is often neglected. In observational studies, we do not know how a unit reached a given state (e.g. what was the intervention that resulted in unit \\(i\\) achieving a BMI of \\(20\\)?). Therefore, we are left with a vague notion of what the causal contrast is.\nIn an RCT, we have exchangeability, which allows us to interpret the associational relationship between the intervention and outcome as a causal relationship. In an observational study, we rely on expert knowledge to identify and adjust for confounding in an attempt to approximate exchangeability, more specifically conditional exchangeability. When the definition of the intervention is vague, adjustment to achieve conditional exchangeability is complicated by virtue of the vast array of factors that could influence both obesity and death.\nAssuming that conditional exchangeability can be achieved, we need representation within each strata in order to produce estimates of the treatment effect that do not resort to extrapolation, e.g. see doi.org/10.1214/13-AOAS630. Following on from above, a large adjustment space increases the likelihood of sparse data, which increases the risk of positivity violations.",

The author of the paper, Judea Pearl, reviews the problems associated with this perspective. For example, we cannot manipulate race in real life but it is common knowledge that there are strong effects of race on numerous outcomes, from health to education to income. Pearl introduces the structural causal model framework as an alternative perspective where:\n\nthe concept of interventions do not require a real-life or physical counterpart and\nthe notion of consistency is not an assumption, but a theorem1 of counterfactual logic.\n\nInstead, variables are causal (or have a causal character) because they respond to changes in other variables",

    "text": "What did they do?\nThe author challenges the Hernan’s position that to talk about the causal effects of obesity is meaningless since a vaguely defined intervention can lead to violations of the consistency assumption.\nPearl first takes umbrage with the way that Hernan presents BMI as the marker for obesity and makes it clear that obesity is should be described with reference to many factors2.\nNext, Pearl raises what he argues is a limitation in the Rubin model whereby counterfactuals may appear inconsistent when the antecedents are conflated with the external intervention devised to enfore the antecedent3.\nPearl then explans the do-operator (he developed the idea) and that it was intended to denote the operation of holding a variable constant. He argues that when Hernan claim that \\(P(mortality = y | do(obesity = x))\\) is undefined because the consequences of obesity depend on how we choose to manipulate it, they missunderstand what the do-operator is intended to represent. Specifically, the do-operator does not depend on any choice of intervention, it is defined relative to a hypothetical, minimal intervention needed to establish \\(X = x\\), i.e. it is defined independently to how the event came about.\nPearl goes into this in more depth to expand on this point, but I don’t believe that add much to his argument.\nNext Pearl discusses the idea of scientific versus policy-based causation and does provide some analogies. One that I liked was his reference to the ideal gas law4 \\(PV = kNT\\) that approximation of the behavior of many gases where \\(P\\) is the absolute pressure of a gas, \\(V\\) is the volume it occupies, \\(N\\) is the number of atoms and molecules in the gas, and \\(T\\) is its absolute temperature. The constant \\(k\\) is called the Boltzmann constant and has the value \\(k = 1.38 × 10−23 J/K\\). Thus whenever changes in pressure are always accompanied by changes in \\(V\\), \\(N\\) and/or \\(T\\). These, like both the diet and exercise interventions in Hernan’s obesity example, have side effects. However, we generally do not consider it necessary to talk about \\(V\\), \\(N\\) or \\(T\\) when we are talking about e.g. how tyre pressure effects the likelihood of punctures on unsealed roads, or a bumpy ride in general.\nPearl caveats the hard versus soft science perspectives, but the alternative perspective is welcome in stressing the need to avoid locking ourselves into pigeon holes.",

This paper is no exception and therefore I may have missed some important points or subtleties in this summary. For example, what Pearl means by causal character is unclear to me.\nSome of the critique on consistency as an assumption versus consistency as a theorem was unclear due to my own ignorance with alternative causal inference, specifically Pearl’s approach.\nPearls argument rests primarily on the validity of his conceptualisation of causal inference, which is founded on a large body of work drawing from philosophy, science, mathematics and statistics. I am not sure that it provides a clear way forward and the applied researcher is left to choose which approach to adopt with limited guidance.
